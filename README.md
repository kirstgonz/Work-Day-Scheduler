# Work Day Scheduler

The work day scheduler was created to help users keep track of tasks throughout their workday from 9am to 5pm.


## Description

The work day scheduler aides users in keeping track of what tasks they need to complete throught the work day between the hours of 9am to 5pm. The website offers nine different time blocks in which users and type their tasks for the day and save them. The time blocks are color coded. If the time is within the hour, the time block is colored red. If the time is in the past, the time block is colored gray. If the time is in the future, it is colored green. Users click the 'save' button to save tasks to local storage. If users close the page or reload, tasks remain. The tasks are editable and deletable. The user only has to press save with any changes they make.
